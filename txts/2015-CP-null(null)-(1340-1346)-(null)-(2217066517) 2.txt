Abstract
We present a neural network method for review rat-
ing prediction in this paper. Existing neural net-
work methods for sentiment prediction typically
only capture the semantics of texts, but ignore the
user who expresses the sentiment. This is not desir-
able for review rating prediction as each user has an
influence on how to interpret the textual content of a
review. For example, the same word (e.g. "good")
might indicate different sentiment strengths when
written by different users. We address this issue
by developing a new neural network that takes user
information into account. The intuition is to fac-
tor in user-specific modification to the meaning of
a certain word. Specifically, we extend the lexical
semantic composition models and introduce a user-
word composition vector model (UWCVM), which
effectively captures how user acts as a function af-
fecting the continuous word representation. We in-
tegrate UWCVM into a supervised learning frame-
work for review rating prediction, and conduct ex-
periments on two benchmark review datasets. Ex-
perimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method. It shows superior performances over
several strong baseline methods.

Introduction
Sentiment analysis and opinion mining [Pang and Lee, 2008;
Liu, 2012] has attracted a lot of attentions from both indus-
try and research communities in recent years. A fundamental
problem in sentiment analysis is to inference the sentiment
polarity (e.g. "thumbs up" or "thumbs down") of a docu-
ment [Pang et al., 2002]. In this paper, we target at a finer
grained document-level problem, known as review rating
prediction [Pang and Lee, 2005]. Given a review written by a
user as input, it calls for inferring the author's evaluation with
respect to a numeric ratings (e.g. one to five stars). Majority
of existing studies follow Pang and Lee [2005] and cast this
problem as a multiclass classification/regression task. They
typically employ machine learning algorithms in a supervised
learning manner, and build the rating predictor from reviews

with accompanying ratings. Under this direction, most stud-
ies focus on designing effective context-level [Qu et al., 2010]
and user-level features [Gao et al., 2013] for obtaining a bet-
ter prediction performance.
Feature engineering is important but labor intensive.
It
is therefore desirable to extract and organize discriminative
features (or representations) automatically from data [Ben-
gio et al., 2013]. For document-level sentiment prediction,
an effective way is to learn continuous text representation
with neural network. Existing neural network method typi-
cally learn continuous word representations (also known as
word embeddings) from text corpus [Mikolov et al., 2013;
Pennington et al., 2014], and then use them to calculate
the representation of a document with semantic composition
[Socher et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014;
Li et al., 2015]. Despite the apparent success of existing neu-
ral network methods, they are not effective enough if directly
used for review rating prediction. The reason lies in that they
typically only use textual semantics of words, but ignore the
review author who expresses the sentiment. It is not desirable
because different users may use different words to express
sentiment, and the same word might indicate different mean-
ings when it is written by different users. For example, a criti-
cal user might use "good" to express an excellent attitude, but
a lenient user may use "good" to evaluate an ordinary prod-
uct.
In this paper, we introduce a novel neural network method
for review rating prediction by taking user information into
account. The intuitive idea is to factor in user-specific mod-
ification to the meaning of a certain word. To this end, we
extend existing lexical semantic composition methods [Clark
et al., 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli, 2010], and introduce a
user-word composition vector model (UWCVM) to effec-
tively incorporate user information. Specifically, we employ
matrix-vector multiplication as the basic composition func-
tion of UWCVM. We represent each word as a continuous
vector and each user as a matrix which maps the original word
vector to the modified representation. Matrix-vector multipli-
cation is tailored for this scenario, since it can be thought of as
a matrix modifying a vector in the field of vector-based com-
positional semantics [Mitchell and Lapata, 2010]. We inte-
grate UWCVM into a feed-forward neural network for review
rating prediction, as illustrated in Figure 1. As is shown, a
document composition vector model (DCVM) takes the mod-

ified word vector as input and produces the representation of a
review. The result of DCVM is leveraged as features to build
the rating predictor without any feature engineering. The user
representation and parameters of neural networks are trained
in an end-to-end fashion with back propagation.
We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method for review rating prediction. We use
two benchmark datasets: one from movie reviews in Rot-
ten Tomatoes and another from restaurant reviews in Yelp
Dataset Challenge 2013. Extensive experimental results show
that (1) the proposed method outperforms several strong base-
line methods which only use textual semantics; (2) for the
task of review rating prediction, matrix-vector multiplication
is more effective to model user-word composition than vector
concatenation or addition methods. The main contributions
presented in this work are listed as follows:
• We represent user-word composition as matrix-vector
multiplication, regarding each user as a matrix that mod-
ifies the meaning of a certain word.
• To our knowledge, this is the first neural network method
that incorporates user information for review rating pre-
diction.
• We report empirical results on two benchmark datasets.
The proposed method performs better than strong base-
line methods on the Yelp dataset.

Review Rating Prediction
Review rating prediction is a fundamental task in sentiment
analysis.
It goes beyond the binary sentiment classifica-
tion (thumbs up or thumbs down) and targets at predicting
the numeric rating (e.g 1∼5 stars) of a given review. Pang
and Lee [2005] pioneer this field by regarding review rating
prediction as a classification/regression problem. They build
the rating predictor with machine learning method under a
supervised metric labeling framework. Following Pang and
Lee [2005]'s work, most studies focus on designing effective
textural features of reviews, since the performance of a rating
predictor is heavily dependent on the choice of feature repre-
sentation of data. For example, Qu et al. [2010] introduce the
bag-of-opinion feature, which consists of sentiment, modifi-
cation and negation words.
Beyond textural features, user information is also investi-
gated in the literature of sentiment analysis. For review rating
prediction, Gao et al. [2013] develop user-specific features to
capture the user leniency; Li et al. [2014] incorporate tex-
tual topic and user-word factors through topic modeling. [Wu
and Ester, 2015] leverage user information with a combina-
tion between collaborative filtering and aspect based opinion
mining. Tan et al. [2011] use user information for Twitter sen-
timent analysis. Unlike most previous studies that use hand-
crafted textual or user-relevant features, we learn explanatory
features automatically from data for review rating prediction.
Unlike Li et al. [2014] and Diao et al. [Diao et al., 2014]
that models user information via topic modeling, we integrate
user-word composition in a neural network approach.
2.2
Deep Learning for Sentiment Prediction
Deep learning has been proven to be effective for many sen-
timent analysis tasks [Socher et al., 2013; Tang et al., 2014a;
Xu et al., 2014]. For sentence/document sentiment predic-
tion, the magic of deep learning is to learn continuous rep-
resentations of texts with different grains (e.g. word, phrase,
sentence and document). Existing neural network methods
typically include two stages. They first learn word embed-
ding1 from text corpora, and then utilize semantic composi-
tion models [Mitchell and Lapata, 2010] to compose the rep-
resentation of a document based on the representations of the
words it contains. For learning word embedding, Mikolov
et al. [2013] introduce a context-prediction method resulting
in word2vec. Pennington et al. [2014] take consideration of
global word-word co-occurrence. Maas et a. [2011] and Tang
et al. [2014b] propose to learn sentiment-specific word vec-
tors with topic modeling and neural networks, respectively.
For learning semantic composition, Glorot et al. [2011] use
stacked denoising autoencoder; Socher et al. [2013] intro-
duce a family of recursive deep neural networks (RNN); Li
[2014] extend Recursive Neural Network by using feature
weight tuning to control how much one specific unit con-
tributes to the higher-level representation; [Kalchbrenner et
al., 2014; Kim, 2014] use convolution neural networks; Le
and Mikolov [2014] introduce Paragraph Vector. Li et al.
[2015] compare the effectiveness of recursive neural network
and recurrent neural network on five NLP tasks including sen-
timent classification.
Unlike most previous deep learning approaches that only
consider the semantics of texts, we take user information
into account. Our approach of modeling user-word compo-
sition via matrix-vector multiplication is inspired by the lex-
ical composition models of [Clark et al., 2008; Baroni and
1Word embedding is a continuous word representation that en-
codes each word in a low-dimensional and real valued vector.
1341
Zamparelli, 2010; Socher et al., 2012]. They regard the com-
positional modifier as a matrix, and use matrix-vector multi-
plication as the composition function. For example, Clark et
al. [2008] learn adjective-noun composition. They represent
words by vectors and adjectives by matrices which map the
original noun representation to the modified representation.
Continuous user representation is also exploited in [Kiros et
al., 2014; Perozzi et al., 2014].

Methodology
In this section, we describe the proposed neural network
method for review rating prediction. We give an overview
of our method before presenting the details of two seman-
tic composition models, UWCVM and DCVM. We then de-
scribe the use of our method for review rating prediction in a
supervised metric labeling framework.
3.1
An Overview of the Neural Network Method
Given a review rkj comprised of n words {w1, w2 ... wn}
written by user uk as the input, review rating prediction aims
at inferring the numeric rating (1∼4 or 1∼5 stars) of rkj.
We cast review rating prediction as a multi-class classifica-
tion problem by inferring a discrete rating score.
An overview of the proposed neural network method is
illustrated in Figure 1. As is shown, our method includes
two composition models, the user-word composition vec-
tor model (UWCVM) and the document composition vec-
tor model (DCVM). UWCVM aims at modifying the orig-
inal word vectors with user information. DCVM takes the
modified word vectors as input, and produces review repre-
sentation which is regarded as the feature for predicting re-
view rating. We utilize existing machine learning algorithms
to train the rating predictor in a supervised metric labeling
framework [Pang and Lee, 2005].
3.2
User-Word Composition Vector Model
We describe UWCVM which models user-specific modifi-
cation to the continuous representation of a word. To this
end, a first attempt might consider learning user-specific word
embeddings only from the texts expressed by a certain user.
However, it is impractical as the parameter space is as huge
as Rd×|Vw|×|Vu|, where d is the dimension of each word vec-
tor, |Vw| and |Vu| are the sizes of the word vocabulary and
user vocabulary, respectively. Another downside is that there
might be not enough contexts to effectively train the user-
specific word embeddings for inactive users.
We explore vector-based compositional semantics and
model user modification to word meaning with a computa-
tional composition approach in this paper. Under this per-
spective, additive and multiplicative composition functions
are representative solutions [Mitchell and Lapata, 2010].
Given two vectors v1 and v2 as the input, additive compo-
sition assumes that the output vector p is a linear function of
Cartesian product of v1 and v2, as described below.
p = A × v1 + B × v2
(1)
where A and B are the matrices parameters that encode the
contributes of v1 and v2 to p. Weighted sum p = αv1 +
βv2 and addition p = v1 + v2 are simpler cases of additive
composition functions. Multiplicative composition assumes
that the output p is a linear function of the tensor product of
v1 and v2, as shown below.
p = T × v1 × v2 = U1 × v2
(2)
where T is a tensor of rank 3 that projects the tensor product
of v1 and v2 to p. The partial product of T with v1 can be
considered as producing a matrix U1.

Figure 2: The additive and multiplicative composition func-
tions as UWCVM.
In this paper, we exploit multiplicative composition func-
tion as the user-word composition model2, as illustrated in
Figure 2(b). The reason is that multiplicative composition
can be regarded as one component U1 modifying another v2,
which exactly meet our needs of user modifying word mean-
ing. It has been successfully leveraged to model adjective-
noun composition [Clark et al., 2008; Baroni and Zamparelli,
2010] and adverb-adjective composition [Socher et al., 2012].
Formally, we represent each word wi as a continuous vec-
tor ei ∈ Rd, and each user uk as a matrix Uk ∈ Rd×d,
where d is the dimension of continuous vector.
In prac-
tice, the number of the parameters is still too large if we
encode each user by a d × d matrix for the common vec-
tor length d = 50 or 100. To reduce the parameter size,
we represent user representation by a low-rank plus diago-
nal approximation: Uk = Uk1 × Uk2 + diag(u′), where
Uk1 ∈ Rd×r, Uk2 ∈ Rr×d, u′ ∈ Rd. We regard u′ as a
shared background representation for each user. It is tailored
for the Out-Of-Vocabulary situation, where a user in testing
process is never seen in the training data. After conducting
matrix-vector multiplication, we append an activation layer
(e.g. tanh) for adding the non-linearity property. Accord-
ingly, the final modified word vector pi for the original word
vector ei is calculated as:
pi = tanh(eik) = tanh(Uk × ei)
= tanh((Uk1 × Uk2 + diag(u′)) × ei)
(3)
3.3
Document Composition Vector Model
Document composition vector model (DCVM) takes the user-
modified word vectors as input, and produces the represen-
tation for each review/document. Document-level semantic
composition is an important research topic in sentiment anal-
ysis, and many neural models have been proposed in the liter-
ature [Socher et al., 2013; Kalchbrenner et al., 2014]. How-
ever, it is out of the scope of this work to compare them. In
2We also tried additive composition functions by representing
both words and users as vectors, as shown in Figure 2(a).
1342
this paper, we exploit a simple and effective approach [Her-
mann and Blunsom, 2014], which recursively uses biTanh
function to produce the document representation.
biTanh(p) =
n
�
i=1
tanh(pi−1 + pi)
(4)
Specifically, we first use biTanh to calculate the vector for
each sentence by regarding the user-modified word vectors
as input. We then feed the sentence vectors to biTanh for
generating the document vector vec(doc). Essentially, the
recursive use of biTanh can be viewed as two pairs of bag-
of-word convolutional neural network, whose window size is
two and parameters are clamped as addition and tanh.
3.4
Rating Prediction with Metric Labeling
We apply the learned review representation to review rating
prediction in a supervised metric labeling framework [Pang
and Lee, 2005].
It consists of two cascaded stages.
In
the first stage, we train an initial predictor by only using
the representation of a certain user-review pair. In the ex-
periment, we use softmax to predict the probabilities for
classes (e.g. one to five stars). It is calculated as softmaxi =
exp(zi)
�
i′ exp(zi′), where z ∈ RC is a linear vector transformed
from the user-enhanced review representation vec(doc).
z = W × vec(doc) + b
(5)
where W ∈ RC×d and b ∈ RC are the parameters, C is
the number of the rating classes. We define f(r, l) as the
probability of predicting review r as rating l. For each review
r, we use cross-entropy as the training objective function:
L(r) = −
�
l∈Ls
f g(r, l) · log(f(r, l)) + λθ · |θ|2
F
(6)
where Ls is the set of possible rating classes, f g is the gold
rating distribution3 and f is the predicted rating distribution.
|θ|2
F = �
i θ2
i is a Frobenius norm regularization term and
θ = [Uk1; Uk2; u′; W ; b] stands for the parameters.
In the second stage, we apply the initial classifier and ex-
plicitly encode the idea of "similar items, similar labels" with
metric labeling [Pang and Lee, 2005].
Let dist(l1, l2) =
|l1 − l2| be a distance metric between labels l1 and l2, and
let nn(rkj) be the M nearest neighbors of rkj according to
a review similarity function sim. The objective of metric la-
beling is to minimize the following equation:
T
�
rkj
[−f(rkj, lrkj) + λnn ·
�
r′∈nn(rkj)
dist(lrkj, lr′) · sim(rkj, r′)]
where T is the dev dataset of user-review pairs and λnn is
the trade-off parameter. We use cosine similarity between the
learned review representations as sim.
An advantage of our method is that: the learned review rep-
resentation can be not only regarded as the feature of rkj to
build the initial predictor, but also leveraged to calculate the
similarity between reviews sim(rkj, r′) without using any
hand-crafted features.
3The gold rating distribution of a review has a 1-of-K coding
scheme. It has the same dimension as the number of rating classes,
and only the dimension corresponding to the ground truth is 1, with
all others being 0.
3.5
Model Training
We train the rating predictor in a supervised learning frame-
work from the reviews with accompanying ratings. We take
the derivative of the loss with respect to the whole set of pa-
rameters through back-propagation, and use stochastic gradi-
ent descent with mini-batch to update the parameters. Word
vectors are learned with word2vec4. We empirically set the
vector dimension d as 100, the rank of user matrix r as 3.
The values of W, b and u′ are randomly initialized with the
fan-in trick. We use dropout [Srivastava et al., 2014] to avoid
the neural network being over-fitting. Hyper parameters are
tuned on the development dataset.

Experiment
We conduct experiments for review rating prediction to em-
pirically evaluate the proposed method. We describe the ex-
periment setting and the results in this section.
4.1
Experiment Setting
We conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, Yelp13
and RT05. Yelp13 is a large-scale dataset consisting of restau-
rant reviews from Yelp. It is released by the third round of
the Yelp Dataset Challenge in 2013. RT05 is a movie review
dataset downloaded from Rotten Tomatoes. The statistical
information of Yelp13 and RT05 are detailed in Table 1. For
Yelp13 dataset, human labeled ratings are regarded as gold
standards for model training5.

We conduct experiments in a supervised learning frame-
work. On Yelp13, we split the original corpus into train, dev
and test sets with a 80:10:10 split. We train the rating predic-
tor on the training set, tune parameters on the dev set and eval-
uate on the test set. On RT05, we use 10-fold cross-validation
as in previous studies. We conduct multi-label classification
on these two datasets. Since rating scores stand for sentiment
intensities, we use mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean
squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metrics (as in other
work like [Li et al., 2014]) to measure the divergences be-
tween predicted ratings and gold ratings.

4.2
Baseline Methods
We compare our method with the following baseline methods
for review rating prediction:
• Majority: It is a heuristic method that assigns the major-
ity rating score in the training set to each review in the test
dataset.
• BOW: We represent each review with bag-of-words
(BOW) [Pang and Lee, 2005], and build the rating predictor
with Supported Vector Machine6.
• BOW+BOO: Qu et al. [2010] propose to represent each
document with bag-of-opinion (BOO). We use the concate-
nation of BOW and BOO as features. The sentiment lexicons
are from BingLiu7 and MPQA [Wilson et al., 2005]. The
modifier and negation words come from the Sentiment Sym-
posium Tutorial. We train the rating predictor with SVM.
• VecAvg: We calculate the representation of a review by
averaging the vectors of the words it contains. We use the
word vectors learned from word2vec, and build the classifier
with SVM [Fan et al., 2008].
• RAE: Recursive AutoEncoder (RAE) has proven effec-
tive to learn compositionality for sentiment analysis. We train
RAE using the word vectors pre-trained with word2vec. We
do not compare with RNTN [Socher et al., 2013] because it
depends on a parsed tree structure, which cannot be accu-
rately obtained for the document-level reviews.
• PVDM: Le and Mikolov [2014] propose the Distributed
Memory Model of Paragraph Vectors (PVDM), which is
a state-of-the-art performer on several sentiment analysis
benchmark datasets. We set the window size of PVDM as
9 in the experiments.
• CNN: Convolution neural network is a state-of-the-art
performer on sentence-level sentiment analysis tasks [Kalch-
brenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014].
4.3
Results and Analysis
Table 2 shows the experimental results of the baseline meth-
ods as well as our method on two datasets. Our neural net-
work method that uses user-word composition is abbreviated
as UWRL. UWRL† stands for our neural network method
plus metric labeling.
From Table 2, we can see that the performances of these
methods are consistent on two datasets. Majority performs
very poor as it does not capture any text-level or user-level
information. BOW only uses the surface form of words in the
review. However, it loses the ordering of words and it also ig-
nores the semantics of words. BOW+BOO performs slightly
better than BOW because BOO benefits from the sentiment,
negation and modifier words from external resources. We
also run standard collective filtering baseline on Yelp dataset.
However, its performance is poor and comparable with bag-
of-word baseline.
VecAvg is a straight-forward method that uses word embed-
dings as the features without any feature engineering. From
6In this experiment, we use SVM as baseline because the it per-
forms better than the discretized regression [Pang and Lee, 2005]
with a set of fixed decision thresholds {e.g. 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ...}.

Table 2: Experimental results (lower is better) for review rat-

abbreviated as UWRL and UWRL†.
Table 2, we find that VecAvg does not yield obvious improve-
ment over the traditional BOW. The reason is that the aver-
age function loses the word orders and does not well capture
the complex linguistic phenomena in sentiment analysis. We
also compare with several sophisticated composition methods
including RAE, CNN and PVDM, and find that all of them
outperform the VecAvg baseline. CNN is the strongest base-
line on both datasets. The results indicate the importance of
semantic composition for review rating prediction. The pro-
posed method UWRL slightly outperforms text-based neural
network algorithms as we simultaneously capture text-level
and user-level semantics (p-value < 0.05 with t-test on Yelp13
between CNN and UWRL). After incorporating metric label-
ing, UWRL† captures the idea of "similar items, similar la-
bels" and thus obtains further improvements.
4.4
The Effect of User-Word Composition
We investigate the effect of different user-word composi-
tion functions for review rating prediction.
We compare
the matrix-vector multiplication function (mvMultip) with the
following strategies: No-User: p = ei , Concat: p = [ei; uk],
Average: p = 1/2 · (ei + uk) , ElemMultip: p = ei ⊙ uk,
WAdd: p = A × ei + B × uk, where ei and uk stand for
the word vector and user vector, respectively. We conduct ex-
periments on the development set of Yelp13. The results are
given in Figure 3.

We can find that capturing user information always out-

performs No-User, which shows the effectiveness of user in-
formation for review rating prediction. The performances of
Concat and Average are relatively low because they do not
well exploit the interaction between the user vector and word
vector. Among all these composition functions, matrix-vector
multiplication yields the best performance.
4.5
The Effect of User Activity
We explore the effect of the user activity for review rating pre-
diction on the development set of Yelp13. We use the entire
training dataset to train the model, and test on several subsets
of the development dataset that correspond to different user
activities. For example, the tick "100" on x-axis means that
we only test on the users that have posted no less than 100
reviews.

The results are illustrated in Figure 4. We can see that the

the user representations can be better estimated when more
user-relevant reviews are utilized.

The Effect of Word Embedding
We investigate the effect of word embedding on review rat-
ing prediction. We try the randomly initialized word vec-
tors (Random), the word vectors learned from SkipGram
and the sentiment-specific word embeddings learned from
SSWE [Tang et al., 2014b] and SSPE [Tang et al., 2014a].
From Figure 5, we find that all pre-trained word vectors
outperform randomly initialized word vectors.
Compared
with SkipGram, three SSWE methods do not yield signifi-
cant improvements. This is caused by the fact that SSWE
assign the document polarity to each word sequence it con-
tains for training the word vectors. The assumption is rea-
sonable for tweets as they are short, but it is unsuitable for
the document-level reviews where negation and contrast phe-
nomenons are frequently appeared. SSPE performs slightly
better than others, as it optimizes the word vectors by us-
ing a global document vector to predict the sentiment of a
review. However, sentiment embeddings do not obtain sig-
nificant performance boost than word2vec in this experiment.
This calls for more powerful algorithms to learn sentiment
embeddings from document level corpus.

Yelp13 with different word embeddings.

Conclusion
We introduce a neural network method that incorporates
user information for review rating prediction in this paper.
We model user-specific modification to the meaning of a
certain word with a user-word composition vector model
(UWCVM), and investigate both additive and multiplicative
composition functions for UWCVM. We show that matrix-
vector multiplication is more effective than vector concate-
nation or addition methods for review rating prediction. We
conduct experiments on two benchmark datasets, and com-
pare against multiple baseline methods. Experimental results
show that, the proposed method performs better than several
strong baseline methods which only use textural semantics.
