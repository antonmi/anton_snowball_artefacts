Abstract
Racial bias is an important issue in biometric, but has
not been thoroughly studied in deep face recognition. In
this paper, we first contribute a dedicated dataset called
Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) database, on which we
firmly validated the racial bias of four commercial APIs and
four state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Then, we further
present the solution using deep unsupervised domain adap-
tation and propose a deep information maximization adap-
tation network (IMAN) to alleviate this bias by using Cau-
casian as source domain and other races as target domains.
This unsupervised method simultaneously aligns global dis-
tribution to decrease race gap at domain-level, and learn-
s the discriminative target representations at cluster level.
A novel mutual information loss is proposed to further en-
hance the discriminative ability of network output without
label information. Extensive experiments on RFW, GBU,
and IJB-A databases show that IMAN successfully learn-
s features that generalize well across different races and
across different databases.
1. Introduction
The emergence of deep convolutional neural networks
(CNN) [38, 55, 59, 31, 32] greatly advances the frontier of
face recognition (FR) [63, 58, 54]. However, more and more
people find that a problematic issue, namely racial bias, has
always been concealed in the previous studies due to biased
benchmarks but it explicitly degrades the performance in
realistic FR systems [2, 13, 25, 8]. For example, Amazon's
Rekognition Tool incorrectly matched the photos of 28 U.S.
congressmen with the faces of criminals, especially the er-
ror rate was up to 39% for non-Caucasian people. Although
several studies [49, 29, 23, 50, 36] have uncovered racial
bias in non-deep FR algorithms, this field still remains to be
vacant in deep learning era because so little testing informa-
tion available makes it hard to measure the racial bias.
To facilitate the research towards this issue, in this
work we construct a new Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW)
database, as shown in Fig. 1 and Table 4, to fairly mea-
sure racial bias in deep FR. Based on experiments on RFW,
we find that both commercial APIs and SOTA algorithm-
s indeed suffer from racial bias: the error rates on African
faces are about two times of Caucasians, as shown in Table
1. To investigate the biases caused by training data, we also
collect a race-balanced training database, and validate that
racial bias comes on both data and algorithm aspects. Some
specific races are inherently more difficult to recognize even
trained on the race-balanced training data. Further research
efforts on algorithms are requested to eliminate racial bias.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) [64] is one of
the promising methodologies to address algorithm biases,
which can map two domains into a domain-invariant feature
space and improve target performances in an unsupervised
manner [61, 40, 60, 24]. Unfortunately, most UDA methods
for object recognition are not applicable for FR because of
two unique challenges. First, face identities (classes) of two
domains are non-overlapping in FR, so that many skills in
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods based on sharing classes
are inapplicable. Second, popular methods by the global
alignment of source and target domain are insufficient to
acquire the discriminating power for classification in FR.
How to meet these two challenges is meaningful but few
works have been proposed in this community.

Table 1. Racial bias in deep FR systems. Verification accuracies
(%) evaluated on 6000 difficult pairs of RFW database are given.
In this paper, we propose a new information maxi-
mization adaptation network (IMAN) to mitigate racial
bias, which matches global distribution at domain-level,
at the meantime, learns discriminative target distribution
at cluster-level. To circumvent the non-overlapping class-
es between two domains, IMAN applies a spectral clus-
tering algorithm to generate pseudo-labels, by which the
network is pre-adapted with Softmax and the target perfor-
mance is enhanced preliminarily. This clustering scheme of
IMAN is fundamentally different from other UDA methods
[51, 69, 16, 18] that are inapplicable to FR. Besides pseudo
label based pre-adaptation, a novel mutual information (MI)
based adaptation is proposed to further enhance the discrim-
inative ability of the network output, which learns larger
decision margins in an unsupervised way. Different from
the common supervised losses and supervised MI methods
[56, 34], MI loss takes advantage of all unlabeled target da-
ta, no matter whether they are successfully assigned pseudo-
labels or not, in virtue of its unsupervised property.
Extensive experimental results show that IMAN con-
ducted to transfer recognition knowledge from Caucasian
(source) domain to other-race (target) domains. Its perfor-
mance is much better than other UDA methods. Ablation s-
tudy shows that MI loss has unique effect on reducing racial
bias. In addition, IMAN is also helpful in adapting general
deep model to a specific database, and achieved improved
performance on GBU [48] and IJB-A [37] databases. The
contributions of this work are three aspects. 1) A new RFW
dataset is constructed and is released 1 for the study on racial
bias. 2) Comprehensive experiments on RFW validate the
existence and cause of racial bias in deep FR algorithms. 3)
A novel IMAN solution is introduced to address racial bias.

Racial bias in face recognition. Several studies [49,
29, 23, 50, 36] have uncovered racial bias in non-deep

face recognition algorithms. The FRVT 2002 [49] showed
that recognition accuracies depend on demographic cohort.
Phillips et al. [50] evaluated FR algorithms on the images
of FRVT 2006 [11] and found that algorithms performed
better on natives.
Klare et al.
[36] collected mug shot
face images of White, Black and Hispanic from the Pinel-
las County Sheriff's Office (PCSO) and concluded that the
Black cohorts are more difficult to recognize. In deep learn-
ing era, existing racial bias databases are no longer suitable
for deep FR algorithms due to their small scale and con-
strained conditions; commonly-used testing databases of
deep FR, e.g. LFW [33], IJB-A [37], don't include signif-
icant racial diversity, as shown in Table 2. Although some
studies, e.g. unequal-training [9] and suppressing attributes
[8, 43, 44, 42], have made effort to mitigate racial and gen-
der bias in several computer vision tasks, this study remains
to be vacant in FR. Thus, we construct a new RFW database
to facilitate the research towards this issue.

Deep unsupervised domain adaptation. UDA [64] u-
tilizes labeled data in relevant source domains to execute
new tasks in a target domain [61, 40, 41, 24, 60]. However,
the research of UDA is limited to object classification, very
few studies have focused on UDA for FR task. Luo et al.
[70] integrated the maximum mean discrepancies (MMD)
estimator to CNN to decrease domain discrepancy. Sohn et
al. [57] synthesized video frames from images by a set of
transformations and applied a domain adversarial discrim-
inator to align feature space of image and video domains.
Kan et al. [35] utilized the sparse representation constraint
to ensure that source domain shares similar distribution as
target domain. In this paper, inspired by Inception Score
[52, 10] used in Generative Adversarial Nets (GAN), we in-
troduce MI as a regularization term to domain adaptation
and propose a novel IMAN method to address this unique
challenge of FR in an unsupervised way.
3. Racial Faces in-the-Wild: RFW
Instead of downloading images from websites, we col-
lect them from MS-Celeb-1M [6]. We use the "National-
ity" attribute of FreeBase celebrities [27] to directly select
Asians and Indians. For Caucasians and Africans, Face++
API [4] is used to estimate race. An identity will be accept-
693
ed only if its most images are estimated as the same race,
otherwise it will be abandoned. To avoid the negative ef-
fects caused by the biased Face++ tool, we manually check
some images with low confidence scores from Face++.
Then we construct our RFW database with four test-
ing subsets, namely Caucasian, Asian, Indian and African.
Each subset contains about 10K images of 3K individuals
for face verification. All of these images have been care-
fully and manually cleaned. Besides, in order to exclude
overlapping identities between RFW and commonly-used
training datasets, we further remove the overlapping sub-
jects by manual inspection, when the subject and its nearest
neighbor in CASIA-Webface and VGGFace2 (based on Ar-
cface [21] feature) are found to be of the same identity.
For the performance evaluation, we recommend to use
both the biometric receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve and LFW-like protocol.
Specifically, ROC curve,
which aims to report a comprehensive performance, evalu-
ates algorithms on all pairs of 3K identities (about 14K pos-
itive vs. 50M negative pairs). In contrast, LFW-like proto-
col facilitates easy and fast comparison between algorithms
with 6K pairs of images. Further, inspired by the ugly sub-
set of GBU database [48], we have selected the "difficult"
pairs (in term of cosine similarity) to avoid the saturated
performance to be easily reported 2.

Negative pairs

Examples of pairs in RFW database. We select 6K
difficult pairs according to cosine similarity to avoid saturated per-
formance, these images challenge the recognizer by variations of
same people and the similar appearance of different people.
In RFW, the images of each race are randomly collected
from MS-Celeb-1M without any preference, and thus they
are suitable to fairly measure racial bias. We have validated
that, across varying races, their distributions of pose, age,
and gender are similar. As evidence, the detailed distribu-
tions measured by Face++ API are show in Fig. 3(a)-3(d).
One can see from the figures that there is no significant dif-
ference between different races.
Moreover, the pose and age gap distributions of 3K diffi-
cult positive pairs are show in Fig. 3(e) and 3(f), which indi-
cates that the selected difficult pairs are also fair across dif-

Fig. 2 presents some examples of the 6K selected pairs, and
one can see from the figure that some pairs are very chal-
lenging even for human.
4. Information maximization adaptation net-
work
In our study, source domain is a labeled training set,
namely Ds = {xs
i, ys
i }M
i=1 where xs
i is the i-th source sam-
ple, ys
i is its category label, and M is the number of source
images. Target domain is an unlabeled training set, namely
Dt = {xt
i}N
i=1 where xt
i is the i-th target sample and N is
the number of target images. The data distributions of two
domains are different, P(Xs, Ys) ̸= P(Xt, Yt). Our goal
is to learn deep features invariant between domains and im-
prove the performance of target images (faces of colored
skin in our study) in an unsupervised manner. In the face
recognition task, the identities (class) of two domains are
non-overlapping, which poses a unique challenge different
from other tasks.
4.1.
Clustering-based
pseudo
labels
for
pre-
adaptation
Previous UDA methods apply the source classifier to pre-
dict pseudo-labels in the target domain, by which the net-
work can be fine-tuned using supervised losses [51, 69, 16,
18, 66].
Unfortunately, these well-established approach-
es are inapplicable in face recognition due to the non-
overlapping identities between two domains.
Therefore,
we introduce a clustering algorithm into UDA to generate
pseudo-labels for pre-adaptation training. The detailed step-
s of our clustering algorithm are given as following:
First, we feed unlabeled target data Xt into network and
extract deep features F(Xt). Then, with these deep presen-
tations, we construct a N × N adjacency matrix, where N
is the number of faces in target domain and entry at (i, j),
i.e. s(i, j), is the cosine similarity between target face xt
i
and xt
j.
Second, we can build a clustering graph G(n, e) accord-
ing to adjacency matrix, where the node ni represents i-th
target image and edge e(ni, nj) signifies that two target im-
ages have larger cosine-similarity than the parameter λ:
e(ni, nj) =
� 1,
if s(i, j) > λ
0,
otherwise
(1)
Then, we simply save each connected component with at
least p nodes as a cluster (identity) and obtain pseudo-labels
of these target images; the remaining images will be aban-
doned.
So, we only obtain pseudo-labels of partial im-
ages with higher confidence to alleviate negative influence
caused by falsely-labeled samples. After that, we pre-adapt
the network with the standard Softmax loss.

Figure 4. Overview of IMAN architecture. Step-1: Pseudo-adaptation. Pseudo-labels of target images are generated by clustering
algorithm and then are utilized to pre-adapt the network with supervision of Softmax to obtain preliminary improvement of target domain.
Step-2: MI-adaptation. With mutual information loss, the distribution of target classifier's output is further optimized and larger decision
margins are learned without any label information.
4.2. Mutual information loss for discriminant adap-
tation
Although pre-adaptation has derived preliminary predic-
tion of the target images, it is insufficient to boost the perfor-
mance in target domain due to the imperfection of pseudo-
labels. How can we take full advantage of the full set of
target images and learn more discriminative representation-
s? Based on the preliminary prediction, we propose to fur-
ther optimize the distribution of classifier's output without
any label information. Our idea is to learn large decision
margins in feature space through enlarging the classifier's
output of one class while suppressing those of other classes
in an unsupervised way. Different from supervised mutual
information [56, 19, 45, 34], our MI loss maximizes mutual
information between unlabeled target data Xt and classifi-
er's prediction Ot inspired by [52, 10, 68, 26].
Based on the desideratum that an ideal conditional dis-
tribution of classifier's prediction p(Ot|xt
i) should look
like [0, 0, ..., 1, ..., 0], it's better to classify samples with
large margin. Grandvalet [28] proved that a entropy term
1
N
�N
i=1 H(Ot|xt
i) very effectively meets this requirement,
because it is maximized when the distribution of classifier's
prediction is uniform and vice versa. However, in the case
of fully unsupervised learning, simply minimizing this en-
tropy will cause that more decision boundaries are removed
and most samples are assigned to the same class. Therefore,
we prefer to uniform distribution of category. An estimate
of the marginal distribution of classifier's prediction p(Ot)
is given as follows:
p(Ot) =
�
p(xt
i)p(Ot|xt
i)dxt
i = 1
N
N
�
i=1
p
�
Ot|xt
i
�
(2)
we suggest that maximizing the entropy of Ot can make
samples assigned evenly across the categories of dataset.
In information theory, mutual information between X
and Y , i.e. I(X; Y ), can be expressed as the difference
of two entropy terms:
I(X; Y ) = H(X) − H(X|Y ) = H(Y ) − H(Y |X) (3)
If X and Y are related by a deterministic, invertible func-
tion, then maximal mutual information is attained. In our
case, we combine the two entropy terms and obtain mutual
information between data Xt and prediction Ot:
LM = 1

where the first term is the entropy of conditional distribution
of Ot which can enlarge the classifier's output of one class
while suppressing those of other classes; and the second ter-
m is the entropy of marginal distribution of Ot which can
avoid most samples being assigned to the same class. N is
the number of target images, and NC is the number of tar-
get categories. But without groundtruth labels, how can we
obtain NC and guarantee the accuracy of classifier's predic-
tion? Benefiting from clustering-based pseudo labels, we u-
tilize the number of clusters to substitute for NC, and obtain
preliminary prediction through pre-adaptation to guarantee
accuracy for mutual information loss.
4.3. Adaptation network
As shown in Fig. 4, the architecture of IMAN consists of
a source and target CNN, with shared weights. Maximum
mean discrepancy (MMD) estimator [61, 40, 12, 14], which
is a standard distribution distance metric to measure domain
discrepancy, is adopted on higher layers of network which
are called adaptation layers. We simply use a fork at the
top of the network after the adaptation layer. The inputs of
source CNN are source labeled images while those of target
CNN are target unlabeled data. The goal of training is to
minimize the following loss:
L = LC(Xs, Ys) + α
�
l∈L
MMD2(Dl
s, Dl
t) + βLM(Xt)
(5)
where α and β are the parameters for the trade-off between
three terms. LM(Xt) is our mutual-information loss on un-
labeled target data Xt. LC(Xs, Ys) denotes source classi-
fication loss on the source data Xs and the source label-
s Ys.
Dl
∗ is the l-th layer hidden representation for the
source and target examples, and MMD2(Dl
s, Dl
t) is the
MMD between the source and target evaluated on the l-
th layer representation. The empirical estimate of MMD
between two domains is defined as MMD2(Ds, Dt) =

The entire procedure of IMAN is depicted in Algorithm
1. Source classification loss supervises learning proceeds
for source domain. MMD minimizes the domain discrep-
ancy to learn domain-invariant representations. Additional-
ly, in the pre-training stage, MMD provides more reliable
underlying target representations for clustering leading to
higher quality of pseudo-labels. Clustering-based pseudo-
labels can improve the performance of target domain pre-
liminarily and guarantee the accuracy of network's predic-
tion for unsupervised MI loss. MI loss can further take full
advantage of all target data, no matter whether they are suc-
cessfully clustered or not, to learn larger decision margins
and enhance the discrimination ability of network for target
domain.

5. Experiments on RFW
5.1. Racial bias experiment
Experimental Settings. We use the similar ResNet-34
architecture described in [21]. It is trained with the guid-
ance of Arcface loss [21] on the CAISA-Webface [67], and
is called Arcface(CASIA) model. CASIA-Webface consist-
s of 0.5M images of 10K celebrities in which 85% of the
photos are Caucasians. For preprocessing, we use five fa-
cial landmarks for similarity transformation, then crop and
resize the faces to 112×112. Each pixel ([0, 255]) in RG-
B images is normalized by subtracting 127.5 and then be-
ing divided by 128. We set the batch size, momentum, and
weight decay as 200, 0.9 and 5e−4, respectively. The learn-
ing rate is started from 0.1 and decreased twice with a factor
of 10 when errors plateau.
Existence of racial bias. We extract features of 6000
pairs in RFW by our Arcface(CASIA) model and com-
pare the distribution of cosine-distances, as shown in Fig.
5(c).
The distribution of Caucasian has a more distinc-
t margin than that of other races, which visually proves
the recognition errors of non-Caucasian subjects are much
higher. Then, we also examine some SOTA algorithms, i.e.
Center-loss [65], Sphereface [39], VGGFace2 [15] and Ar-
cFace [21], as well as four commercial recognition APIs,
i.e. Face++, Baidu, Amazon, Microsoft on our RFW. The

biometric ROC curves evaluated on all pairs are presented
in Fig. 6; the accuracies in LFW-like protocol are given in
Table 1 and its ROC curves are given in the Supplemen-
tary Material. First, all SOTA algorithms and APIs perform
the best on Caucasian testing subset, followed by Indian,
and the worst on Asian and African. This is because that
the learned representations predominantly trained on Cau-
casians will discard information useful for discerning non-
Caucasian faces. Second, a phenomenon is found coinci-
dent with [11]: APIs which are developed by East Asian
companies perform better on Asians, while APIs developed
in the Western hemisphere perform better on Caucasians.
Existence of domain gap. The visualization and quan-
titative comparisons are conducted at feature level.
The
deep features of 1.2K images are extracted by our Arc-
face(CASIA) model and are visualized respectively using t-
SNE embeddings [22], as shown in Fig. 5(a). The features
almost completely separate according to race. Moreover,
we use the MMD to compute distribution discrepancy be-
tween the images of Caucasians and other races in Fig. 5(b).
From the figures, we make the same conclusions: the dis-
tribution discrepancies between Caucasians and other races
are much larger than that between Caucasians themselves,
which conforms that there is domain gap between races.
Cause of racial bias. We download more images of non-
Caucasians from Website according to FreeBase celebrities
[27], and construct an Equalizedface dataset. It contains
590K images from 14K celebrities which has the similar
scale with CASIA-Webface database but is approximate-
ly race-balanced with 3.5K identities per race. Using E-
qualizedface as training data, we train an Arcface(Equal)
model in the same way as Arcface(CASIA) model and com-
pare their performances on 6000 difficult pairs of RFW, as
shown in Table 3. Compared with Arcface(CASIA) model,
Arcface(Equal) model trained equally on all races perform-
s much better on non-Caucasians which proves that racial
bias in databases will reflect in FR algorithm. However,
even with balanced training, we see that non-Caucasians
still perform poorly than Caucasians. The reason may be
that faces of colored skin are more difficult to extract and
preprocess feature information, especially in dark situation-
s. Moreover, we also train specific models on 7K identities
of the same race, its performance is a bit lower compared to
balanced training (3.5K people for each race). We believe
there exists cooperative relationships among different races
due to similar low-level features so that this mixture of races
would improve the recognition ability.
5.2. Domain adaptation experiment
Datasets. A training set with four race-subsets is also
constructed according to RFW. One training subset con-
sists of about 500K labeled images of 10k Caucasians and
three other subsets contain 50K unlabeled images of non-
Caucasians, respectively, as shown in Table 4. We use Cau-
casian as source domain and other races as target domains,
and evaluate algorithms on 6000 pairs and all pairs of RFW.

Implementation detail. For preprocessing, we share the
uniform alignment methods as Arcface(CASIA) model as
mentioned above. For MMD, we follow the settings in DAN
[40], and apply MMD to the last two fully-connected layers.
In all experiments, we use ResNet-34 as backbone and set
the batch size, momentum, and weight decay as 200, 0.9 and
5e − 4, respectively. In pre-training stage, the learning rate
is started from 0.1 and decreased twice with a factor of 10
when errors plateau. In pre-adaptation stage, we pre-adapt
network on pseudo-labeled target samples and source sam-
ples using learning rate of 5e − 3. In MI-adaptation stage,
we adapt the network with learning rate of 1e − 3 using all
source and target data. In IMAN-A(Arcface), Arcface [21]
is used as source classification loss and the parameter α, β
and γ are set to be 10, 5 and 0.2, respectively. In IMAN-
S(Softmax), Softmax is used as source classification loss
and the parameter α, β and γ are set to be 2, 5 and 0.2.
Experimental result. Three UDA tasks are performed,
namely transferring knowledge from Caucasian to Indian,
Asian and African. Due to the particularity of task, very few
studies have focused on UDA in FR task. The latest work

method, i.e. DDC [61] and DAN [40], to perform scene
adaptation. Therefore, we also compare our IMAN with
these two UDA methods. DDC adopts single-kernel MMD
on the last fully-connected layers; DAN adopts multi-kernel
MMD on the last two fully-connected layers.

"-S" represents the methods using Softmax as source classification
loss; while "-A" represents the ones using Arcface.
From Table 5 and Fig. 7, we have the following observa-
tions. First, without adaptation, Arcface, which published
in CVPR'19 and reported SOTA performance on the LFW
and MegaFace challenges, can not obtain perfect perfor-
mance on non-Caucasians due to race gap. Second, MMD-
based methods, i.e. DDC and DAN, obtain limited improve-
ment compared with Softmax and Arcface model, which
confirms our thought that the popular methods by the glob-
al alignment of source and target domain are insufficient
for face recognition. Third, we can find that our IMAN-S
and IMAN-A both dramatically outperform all of the com-
pared methods and IMAN-A achieves about 3% gains over

Arcface model. Furthermore, when pre-adapting network
with supervision of Arcface loss instead of Softmax loss in
the second stage, our IMAN-A (denoted as IMAN*-A) is
further improved, and obtains the best performances with
94.15%, 91.15% and 91.42% for Indian, Asian and African
set. Especially, we further optimize IMAN*-A by perform-
ing pre-adaptation and MI-adaptation alternatively and iter-
atively in task Caucasian→African, and show the accuracy
at each iteration in Fig. 8. The performance gradually in-
creases until convergence.

Ablation Study. IMAN consists of two main contribu-
tions comparing with existing UDA methods, i.e. pseudo-
adaptation and MI-adaptation.

tiveness, we perform ablation study using Arcface loss
as source classification loss.
In Table 6, the results of
IMAN w/o pseudo-labels are unsatisfactory because MI
loss depends on pseudo-adaptation to guarantee the accu-
racy of classifier and only performing MI-adaptation with a
randomly-initialized classifier is meaningless. To get a fair
comparison, as we can see from the results of IMAN w/o
MI, pseudo-adaptation is superior to baseline by about 2.3%
on average, and our IMAN outperforms pseudo-adaptation
by about 1.1% benefiting from MI-adaptation. It shows that
each component has unique effect on reducing racial bias.

Visualization.
To demonstrate the transferability of
the IMAN learned features, the visualization comparison-
s are conducted at feature level. First, we randomly ex-
tract the deep features of 10K source and target images in
task Caucasian→African with Arcface model and IMAN-
A model, respectively. The features are visualized using t-
SNE, as shown in Fig. 9(a). After adaptation, more source
and target data begin to mix in feature space so that there is
no boundary between them. Second, we compute domain
discrepancy between source and target domain using Arc-
face and IMAN-A activations respectively. Fig. 9(b) shows
that discrepancy using IMAN-A features is much smaller
than that using Arcface features. Therefore, we conclude
that our IMAN does help to minimize domain discrepan-
cy and align feature space between two domains benefited
from MMD.
Additional experiments on IJB-A and GBU. Besides
race gap, there are other domain gaps which make the learn-
t model degenerate in target domain, e.g. different lighting
condition, pose and image quality. To validate our IMAN
method, we further adopt it to reduce these domain gaps
by using CASIA-Webface as source domain and using G-
BU [48] or IJB-A [37] as target domain. The images in
CASIA-Webface are collected from Internet under uncon-
strained environment and most of the figures are celebrities

taken in ambient lighting. GBU is split into three partitions
with face pairs of different recognition difficulty, i.e. Good,
Bad and Ugly. Each partition consists of a target set and a
query set, and both them contain 1085 images of 437 dis-
tinct people. The images are frontal and are taken outdoors
or indoors in atriums and hallways with digital camera. IJB-
A contains 5,397 images and 2,042 videos of 500 subjects,
and covers large pose variations and contains many blur-
ry video frames. The results on GBU and IJB-A databases
are shown in Table 7 and 8. After adaptation, our IMAN-
A surpasses other compared methods, even better than Arc-
face(CASIA) model. In particular, it outperforms the SOTA
counterparts by a large margin on the GBU, although it is
only based on the unsupervised adaptation.
6. Conclusion
An ultimate face recognition algorithm should perform
fairly on different races. We have done the first step and
create a benchmark, i.e. RFW, to fairly evaluate racial bias.
Through experiments on our RFW, we first verify the exis-
tence of racial bias. Then, we address it in the viewpoint
of domain adaptation and design a novel IMAN method
to bridge the domain gap and transfer knowledge between
races. The comprehensive experiments prove the potential
and effectiveness of our IMAN to reduce racial bias.
