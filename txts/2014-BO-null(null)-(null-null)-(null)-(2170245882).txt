ABSTRACT
In this talk, we will give a high level introduction to our
book entitled "Semantic Matching in Search", which was
published recently in Foundations and Trends in Informa-
tion Retrieval [1]. We will start our talk by pointing out
the importance of semantic matching for natural language
processing and information retrieval. Most of the tasks in
natural language processing and information retrieval, in-
cluding search, question answering, and machine transla-
tion, are based on matching between language expressions.
This approach works quite well in practice; its limitation is
also obvious, however. Sometimes mismatch can occur. We
argue that 'semantic matching' is an effective approach to
overcome the challenge, that is to conduct more semantic
analysis on the language expressions and perform match-
ing between language expressions at semantic level. We will
then introduce the major approaches to semantic matching
in search, developed in the research community in recent

years, including matching by query reformulation, match-
ing with term dependency model, matching with translation
model, matching with topic model, and matching with latent
space model. We will conclude the talk by explaining our
view on the open problems and future directions of semantic
matching.
