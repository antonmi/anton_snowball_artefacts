Abstract
Recent results indicate that the generic descriptors ex-
tracted from the convolutional neural networks are very
powerful [10, 29, 48].
This paper adds to the mount-
ing evidence that this is indeed the case.
We report on
a series of experiments conducted for different recogni-
tion tasks using the publicly available code and model of
the OverFeat network which was trained to perform ob-
ject classification on ILSVRC13. We use features extracted
from the OverFeat network as a generic image represen-
tation to tackle the diverse range of recognition tasks of
object image classification, scene recognition, fine grained
recognition, attribute detection and image retrieval applied
to a diverse set of datasets. We selected these tasks and
datasets as they gradually move further away from the orig-
inal task and data the OverFeat network was trained to
solve. Astonishingly, we report consistent superior results
compared to the highly tuned state-of-the-art systems in
all the visual classification tasks on various datasets. For
instance retrieval it consistently outperforms low memory
footprint methods except for sculptures dataset. The results
are achieved using a linear SVM classifier (or L2 distance
in case of retrieval) applied to a feature representation of
size 4096 extracted from a layer in the net. The representa-
tions are further modified using simple augmentation tech-
niques e.g. jittering. The results strongly suggest that fea-
tures obtained from deep learning with convolutional nets
should be the primary candidate in most visual recognition
tasks.
1. Introduction
"Deep learning.
How well do you think it would work
for your computer vision problem?" Most likely this ques-
tion has been posed in your group's coffee room.
And
in response someone has quoted recent success stories
[29, 15, 10] and someone else professed skepticism. You
may have left the coffee room slightly dejected thinking

large amount of labelled data to train my own network to
quickly find out the answer". But when the convolutional
neural network OverFeat [38] was recently made pub-
licly available1 it allowed for some experimentation.
In
particular we wondered now, not whether one could train
a deep network specifically for a given task, but if the fea-
tures extracted by a deep network - one carefully trained
on the diverse ImageNet database to perform the specific
task of image classification - could be exploited for a wide
variety of vision tasks. We now relate our discussions and
general findings because as a computer vision researcher
you've probably had the same questions:
Prof: First off has anybody else investigated this issue?
Student: Well it turns out Donahue et al. [10], Zeiler
and Fergus [48] and Oquab et al. [29] have suggested that
generic features can be extracted from large CNNs and pro-
vided some initial evidence to support this claim. But they
have only considered a small number of visual recognition
1There are other publicly available deep learning implementations such
as Alex Krizhevsky's ConvNet and Berkeley's Caffe. Benchmarking
these implementations is beyond the scope of this paper.
1
tasks. It would be fun to more thoroughly investigate how
powerful these CNN features are. How should we start?
Prof: The simplest thing we could try is to extract an image
feature vector from the OverFeat network and combine
this with a simple linear classifier. The feature vector could
just be the responses, with the image as input, from one of
the network's final layers. For which vision tasks do you
think this approach would be effective?
Student: Definitely image classification.
Several vision
groups have already produced a big jump in performance
from the previous sate-of-the-art methods on Pascal VOC.
But maybe fine-tuning the network was necessary for the
jump? I'm going to try it on Pascal VOC and just to make
it a little bit trickier the MIT scene dataset.
Answer: OverFeat does a very good job even without
fine-tuning (section 3.2 for details).
Prof: Okay so that result confirmed previous findings and
is perhaps not so surprising. We asked the OverFeat fea-
tures to solve a problem that they were trained to solve.
And ImageNet is more-or-less a superset of Pascal VOC.
Though I'm quite impressed by the indoor scene dataset re-
sult. What about a less amenable problem?
Student:
I know fine-grained classification.
Here we
want to distinguish between sub-categories of a category
such as the different species of flowers. Do you think the
more generic OverFeat features have sufficient represen-
tational power to pick up the potentially subtle differences
between very similar classes?
Answer: It worked great on a standard bird and flower
database. In its most simplistic form it didn't beat the latest
best performing methods but it is a much cleaner solution
with ample scope for improvement. Actually, adopting a
set of simple data augmentation techniques (still with lin-
ear SVM) beats the best performing methods. Impressive!
(Section 3.4 for details.)
Prof: Next challenge attribute detection? Let's see if the
OverFeat features have encoded something about the se-
mantic properties of people and objects.
Student: Do you think the global CNN features extracted
from the person's bounding box can cope with the articu-
lations and occlusions present in the H3D dataset. All the
best methods do some sort of part alignment before classi-
fication and during training.
Answer: Surprisingly the CNN features on average beat
poselets and a deformable part model for the person at-
tributes labelled in the H3D dataset. Wow, how did they
do that?! They also work extremely well on the object at-
tribute dataset. Maybe these OverFeat features do indeed
encode attribute information? (Details in section 3.5.)
Prof: Can we push things even further? Is there a task
OverFeat features should struggle with compared to
more established computer vision systems? Maybe instance
retrieval. This task drove the development of the SIFT and
VLAD descriptors and the bag-of-visual-words approach
followed swiftly afterwards. Surely these highly optimized
engineered vectors and mid-level features should win hands
down over the generic features?
Student: I don't think CNN features have a chance if we
start comparing to methods that also incorporate 3D geo-
metric constraints. Let's focus on descriptor performance.
Do new school descriptors beat old school descriptors in the
old school descriptors' backyard?
Answer: Very convincing. Ignoring systems that impose
3D geometry constraints the CNN features are very com-
petitive on building and holiday datasets (section 4). Fur-
thermore, doing standard instance retrieval feature process-
ing (i.e. PCA, whitening, renormalization) it shows superior
performance compared to low memory footprint methods
on all retrieval benchmarks except for the sculptures dataset.
Student: The take home message from all these results?
Prof: It's all about the features! SIFT and HOG descriptors
produced big performance gains a decade ago and now deep
convolutional features are providing a similar breakthrough
for recognition. Thus, applying the well-established com-
puter vision procedures on CNN representations should po-
tentially push the reported results even further. In any case,
if you develop any new algorithm for a recognition task then
it must be compared against the strong baseline of generic
deep features + simple classifier.
2. Background and Outline
In this work we use the publicly available trained CNN
called OverFeat [38]. The structure of this network fol-
lows that of Krizhevsky et al. [22]. The convolutional lay-
ers each contain 96 to 1024 kernels of size 3×3 to 7×7.
Half-wave rectification is used as the nonlinear activation
function. Max pooling kernels of size 3×3 and 5×5 are
used at different layers to build robustness to intra-class de-
formations. We used the "large" version of the OverFeat
network. It takes as input color images of size 221×221.
Please consult [38] and [22] for further details.
OverFeat was trained for the image classification task of
ImageNet ILSVRC 2013 [1] and obtained very competitive
results for the classification task of the 2013 challenge and
won the localization task. ILSVRC13 contains 1.2 million
images which are hand labelled with the presence/absence
of 1000 categories. The images are mostly centered and
the dataset is considered less challenging in terms of clutter
and occlusion than other object recognition datasets such as
PASCAL VOC [12].
We report results on a series of experiments we conducted
on different recognition tasks. The tasks and datasets were
selected such that they gradually move further away from
the task the OverFeat network was trained to perform.
We have two sections for visual classification (Sec. 3) and
visual instance retrieval (Sec. 4) where we review different
tasks and datasets and report the final results. The crucial
thing to remember is that the CNN features used are trained
only using ImageNet data though the simple classifiers are
trained using images specific to the task's dataset.
Finally, we have to point out that, given enough computa-
tional resources, optimizing the CNN features for specific
tasks/datasets would probably boost the performance of the
simplistic system even further [29, 15, 51, 43, 41].
3. Visual Classification
Here we go through different tasks related to visual classi-
fication in the following subsections.
3.1. Method
For all the experiments, unless stated otherwise, we use the
first fully connected layer (layer 22) of the network as our
feature vector. Note the max-pooling and rectification oper-
ations are each considered as a separate layer in OverFeat
which differs from Alex Krizhevsky's ConvNet number-
ing. For all the experiments we resize the whole image (or
cropped sub-window) to 221×221. This gives a vector of
4096 dimensions. We have two settings:
• The feature vector is further L2 normalized to unit
length for all the experiments. We use the 4096 di-
mensional feature vector in combination with a Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM) to solve different classifi-
cation tasks (CNN-SVM).
• We further augment the training set by adding
cropped and rotated samples and doing component-
wise power transform and report separate results (CN-
Naug+SVM).
For the classification scenarios where the labels are not mu-
tually exclusive (e.g. VOC Object Classification or UIUC
Object attributes) we use a one-against-all strategy, in the
rest of experiments we use one-against-one linear SVMs
with voting. For all the experiments we use a linear SVM
found from eq.1, where we have training data {(xi, yi)}.

tails at section 3.6.
3.2. Image Classification
To begin, we adopt the CNN representation to tackle the
problem of image classification of objects and scenes. The
system should assign (potentially multiple) semantic labels
to an image. Remember in contrast to object detection, ob-
ject image classification requires no localization of the ob-
jects. The CNN representation has been optimized for the
object image classification task of ILSVRC. Therefore, in
this experiment the representation is more aligned with the
final task than the rest of experiments. However, we have
chosen two different image classification datasets, objects
and indoor scenes, whose image distributions differ from
that of ILSVRC dataset.
3.2.1
Datasets
We use two challenging recognition datasets, Namely, Pas-
cal VOC 2007 for object image classification [12] and the
MIT-67 indoor scenes [36] for scene recognition.
Pascal VOC. Pascal VOC 2007 [12] contains ∼10000 im-
ages of 20 classes including animals, handmade and nat-
ural objects. The objects are not centered and in general
the appearance of objects in VOC is perceived to be more
challenging than ILSVRC. Pascal VOC images come with
bounding box annotation which are not used in our experi-
ments.
MIT-67 indoor scenes. The MIT scenes dataset has 15620
images of 67 indoor scene classes. The dataset consists
of different types of stores (e.g. bakery, grocery) residen-
tial rooms (e.g. nursery room, bedroom), public spaces (e.g.
inside bus, library, prison cell), leisure places (e.g. buffet,
fastfood, bar, movietheater) and working places (e.g. of-
fice, operating room, tv studio). The similarity of the ob-
jects present in different indoor scenes makes MIT indoor
an especially difficult dataset compared to outdoor scene
datasets.
3.2.2
Results of PASCAL VOC Object Classification
Table 1 shows the results of the OverFeat CNN rep-
resentation for object image classification.
The perfor-
mance is measured using average precision (AP) criterion
of VOC 2007 [12]. Since the original representation has
been trained for the same task (on ILSVRC) we expect the
results to be relatively high. We compare the results only
with those methods which have used training data outside
the standard Pascal VOC 2007 dataset. We can see that the
method outperforms all the previous efforts by a significant
margin in mean average precision (mAP). Furthermore, it
has superior average precision on 10 out of 20 classes. It is
worth mentioning the baselines in Table 1 use sophisticated
matching systems. The same observation has been recently
made in another work [29].
Different layers.
Intuitively one could reason that the
learnt weights for the deeper layers could become more spe-
cific to the images of the training dataset and the task it is
trained for. Thus, one could imagine the optimal represen-
tation for each problem lies at an intermediate level of the
network. To further study this, we trained a linear SVM for
all classes using the output of each network layer. The re-
sult is shown in Figure 2a. Except for the fully connected

Table 1: Pascal VOC 2007 Image Classification Results compared to other methods which also use training data outside VOC. The CNN representation
is not tuned for the Pascal VOC dataset. However, GHM [8] learns from VOC a joint representation of bag-of-visual-words and contextual information.
AGS [11] learns a second layer of representation by clustering the VOC data into subcategories. NUS [39] trains a codebook for the SIFT, HOG and LBP
descriptors from the VOC dataset. Oquab et al. [29] adapt the CNN classification layers and achieves better results (77.7) indicating
the potential to boost the performance by further adaptation of the representation to the target task/dataset.

same trend in the individual class plots. The subtle drops in
the mid layers (e.g. 4, 8, etc.) is due to the "ReLU" layer
which half-rectifies the signals. Although this will help the
non-linearity of the trained model in the CNN, it does not
help if immediately used for classification.

indoor dataset. The performance is measured by the aver-
age classification accuracy of different classes (mean of the

resentation with linear SVMs training significantly outper-
forms a majority of the baselines. The non-CNN baselines

guish between, especially for close-up views of the scenes.

Furthermore, Improved Fisher Vector (IFV) representation has dimension-
ality larger than 200K. [16] has very recently tuned a multi-scale orderless
pooling of CNN features (off-the-shelf) suitable for certain tasks. With this
simple modification they achieved significant average classification accu-
racy of 68.88.
3.3. Object Detection
Unfortunately, we have not conducted any experiments for
using CNN off-the-shelf features for the task of object de-
tection. But it is worth mentioning that Girshick et al. [15]
have reported remarkable numbers on PASCAL VOC 2007
using off-the-shelf features from Caffe code. We repeat
their relevant results here. Using off-the-shelf features they
achieve a mAP of 46.2 which already outperforms state
of the art by about 10%. This adds to our evidences of
how powerful the CNN features off-the-shelf are for visual
recognition tasks.
Finally, by further fine-tuning the representation for PAS-
CAL VOC 2007 dataset (not off-the-shelf anymore) they
achieve impressive results of 53.1.
3.4. Fine grained Recognition
Fine grained recognition has recently become popular due
to its huge potential for both commercial and cataloging
applications.
Fine grained recognition is specially inter-
esting because it involves recognizing subclasses of the
same object class such as different bird species, dog breeds,
flower types, etc. The advent of many new datasets with
fine-grained annotations such as Oxford flowers [27], Cal-
tech bird species [45], dog breeds [1], cooking activi-
ties [37], cats and dogs [32] has helped the field develop
quickly. The subtlety of differences across different subor-
dinate classes (as opposed to different categories) requires a
fine-detailed representation. This characteristic makes fine-
grained recognition a good test of whether a generic repre-
sentation can capture these subtle details.
3.4.1
Datasets
We evaluate CNN features on two fine-grained recognition
datasets CUB 200-2011 and 102 Flowers.
Caltech-UCSD Birds (CUB) 200-2011 dataset [45] is cho-
sen since many recent methods have reported performance
on it. It contains 11,788 images of 200 bird subordinates.
5994 images are used for training and 5794 for evaluation.
Many of the species in the dataset exhibit extremely subtle
differences which are sometimes even hard for humans to
distinguish. Multiple levels of annotation are available for
this dataset - bird bounding boxes, 15 part landmarks, 312
binary attributes and boundary segmentation. The majority
of the methods applied use the bounding box and part land-
marks for training. In this work we only use the bounding
box annotation during training and testing.
Oxford 102 flowers dataset [27] contains 102 categories.
Each category contains 40 to 258 of images. The flowers
appear at different scales, pose and lighting conditions. Fur-
thermore, the dataset provides segmentation for all the im-
ages.
3.4.2
Results
Table 3 reports the results of the CNN-SVM compared to
the top performing baselines on the CUB 200-2011 dataset.
The first two entries of the table represent the methods
which only use bounding box annotations. The rest of base-
lines use part annotations for training and sometimes for
evaluation as well.
Table 4 shows the performance of CNN-SVM and other
baselines on the flowers dataset. All methods, bar the CNN-
SVM, use the segmentation of the flower from the back-
ground. It can be seen that CNN-SVM outperforms all basic
representations and their multiple kernel combination even
without using segmentation.
3.5. Attribute Detection
An attribute within the context of computer vision is de-
fined as some semantic or abstract quality which different
instances/categories share.
3.5.1
Datasets
We use two datasets for attribute detection. The first dataset
is the UIUC 64 object attributes dataset [13]. There are 3

details).
Table 6 reports the results of the detection of 9 human at-
tributes on the H3D dataset including poselets and DPD
[50]. Both poselets and DPD use part-level annotations dur-
ing training while for the CNN we only extract one feature
from the bounding box around the person. The CNN repre-
sentation performs as well as DPD and significantly outper-
forms poselets.

H3D Human Attributes dataset results. A CNN represen-
tation is extracted from the bounding box surrounding the person. All the
other methods require the part annotations during training. The first row
shows the performance of a random classifier. The work of Zhang et al.
[51] has adapted the CNN architecture specifically for the task of attribute
detection and achieved the impressive performance of 78.98 in mAP. This
further highlights the importance of adapting the CNN architecture for dif-
ferent tasks given enough computational resources.
3.6. Implementation Details
We have used precomputed linear kernels with libsvm for
the CNN-SVM experiments and liblinear for the CNNaug-
SVM with the primal solver (#samples ≫ #dim). Data aug-
mentation is done by making 16 representations for each
sample (original image, 5 crops, 2 rotation and their mir-
rors). The cropping is done such that the subwindow con-
tains 4/9 of the original image area from the 4 corners and
the center.
We noted the following phenomenon for all
datasets. At the test time, when we have multiple repre-
sentations for a test image, taking the sum over all the re-
sponses works outperforms taking the max response. In
CNNaug-SVM we use signed component-wise power trans-
form by raising each dimension to the power of 2. For the
datasets which with bounding box (i.e. birds, H3D) we en-
larged the bounding box by 150% to include some context.
In the early stages of our experiments we noticed that us-
ing one-vs-one approach works better than structured SVM
for multi-class learning. Finally, we noticed that using the
imagemagick library for image resizing has slight adverse
effects compared to matlab imresize function. The cross-
validated SVM parameter (C) used for different datasets are
as follows. VOC2007:0.2, MIT67:2 , Birds:2, Flowers:2,
H3D:0.2 UIUCatt:0.2.2

4. Visual Instance Retrieval
In this section we compare the CNN representation to
the current state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines including
VLAD[4, 52], BoW, IFV[33], Hamming Embedding[17]
and BoB[3]. Unlike the CNN representation, all the above
methods use dictionaries trained on similar or same dataset
as they are tested on. For a fair comparison between the
methods, we only report results on representations with
relevant order of dimensions and exclude post-processing
methods like spatial re-ranking and query expansion.
4.1. Datasets
We report retrieval results on five common datasets in the
area as follows:
Oxford5k buildings[34] This is a collection of 5063 refer-
ence photos gathered from flickr, and 55 queries of different
buildings. From an architectural standpoint the buildings
in Oxford5k are very similar. Therefore it is a challenging
benchmark for generic features such as CNN.
Paris6k buildings[35] Similar to the Oxford5k, this col-
lection has 55 queries images of buildings and monuments
from Paris and 6412 reference photos. The landmarks in
Paris6k have more diversity than those in Oxford5k.
Sculptures6k[3] This dataset brings the challenge of
smooth and texture-less item retrieval. It has 70 query im-
ages and contains 6340 reference images which is halved to
train/test subsets. The results on this dataset highlights the
extent to which CNN features are able to encode shape.
Holidays dataset[19] This dataset contains 1491 images
of which 500 are queries.
It contains images of differ-
ent scenes, items and monuments. Unlike the first three
datasets, it exhibits a diverse set of images. For the above
datasets we reported mAP as the measurement metric.
UKbench[28] A dataset of images of 2250 items each from
four different viewpoints. The UKbench provides a good
benchmark for viewpoint changes. We reported recall at
top four as the performance over UKBench.
4.2. Method
Similar to the previous tasks we use the L2 normalized out-
put of the first fully connected layer as representation.
Spatial search. The items of interest can appear at different
locations and scales in the test and reference images mak-
ing some form of spatial search necessary. Our crude search
has the following form. For each image we extract multi-
ple sub-patches of different sizes at different locations. Let
h (the number of levels) represent the number of different
sized patches we extract. At level i, 1 ≤ i ≤ h, we extract
i2 overlapping sub-patches of the same size whose union
covers the whole image. For each extracted sub-patch we
compute its CNN representation. The distance between a
query sub-patch and a reference image is defined as the min-

Table 7: The result of object retrieval on 5 datasets. All the meth-
ods except the CNN have their representation trained on datasets simi-
lar to those they report the results on. The spatial search result on Ox-
ford5k,Paris6k and Sculpture6k, are reported for hr = 4 and hq = 3. It
can be seen that CNN features, when compared with low-memory footprint
methods, produce consistent high results. ASMK+MA [42] and fine-vocab
[26] use in order of million codebooks but with various tricks including bi-
narization they reduce the memory foot print to 64k.
imum L2 distance between the query sub-patch and respec-
tive reference sub-patches. Then, the distance between the
reference and the query image is set to the average distance
of each query sub-patch to the reference image. In contrast
to visual classification pipelines, we extract features from
the smallest square containing the region of interest (as op-
posed to resizing). In the reset of the text, hr denotes to the
number of levels for the reference image and similarly hq
for the query image.
Feature Augmentation.
Successful instance retrieval
methods have many feature processing steps. Adopting the
proposed pipeline of [18] and followed by others [16, 42]
we process the extracted 4096 dim features in the following
way: L2 normalize → PCA dimensionality reduction →
whitening → L2 renormalization. Finally, we further use
a signed component wise power transform and raise each
dimension of the feature vector to the power of 2. For all
datasets in the PCA step we reduce the dimensionality of
the feature vector to 500. All the L2 normalizations are ap-
plied to achieve unit length.
4.3. Results
The result of different retrieval methods applied to 5
datasets are in table 7. Spatial search is only used for the
first three datasets which have samples in different scales
and locations. For the other two datasets we used the same
jittering as explained in Sec. 3.1
It should be emphasized that we only reported the results on
low memory footprint methods.
5. Conclusion
In this work, we used an off-the-shelf CNN representa-
tion, OverFeat, with simple classifiers to address different
recognition tasks. The learned CNN model was originally
optimized for the task of object classification in ILSVRC
2013 dataset. Nevertheless, it showed itself to be a strong
competitor to the more sophisticated and highly tuned state-
of-the-art methods. The same trend was observed for var-
ious recognition tasks and different datasets which high-
lights the effectiveness and generality of the learned repre-
sentations. The experiments confirm and extend the results
reported in [10]. We have also pointed to the results from
works which specifically optimize the CNN representations
for different tasks/datasets achieving even superior results.
Thus, it can be concluded that from now on, deep learning
with CNN has to be considered as the primary candidate in
essentially any visual recognition task.
